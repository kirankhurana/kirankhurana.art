	<p>In trying to grapple with the weight of the our time in Berlin, I found myself looking to identify a single artwork that I could use to describe the sum of the collective experience to me. This proved to be a challenge because where one piece would feel wholesome, there would always be another that provided a certain kind of aesthetic or contextual nuance that was previously unaccounted for.</p>

	<p>I pride myself on being a diligent notetaker, so I resorted to my notebook and came across the following from our first visit to the <a href="http://bb10.berlinbiennale.de/">Biennale</a>  at the KW Institute: A Silent Revolution. ‘Stretch, more. You forget how your body moves and become rigid. You become two lines’.</p>

	<p>The invitation to participate in Sitting on a Man’s Head (2018) by Okuwi Okpokwasili was an invitation to take up space. I was initially nervous about the interaction, because it seemed to be an invitation into a kind of heightened self awareness that could potentially be uncomfortable. But instead, the interaction was simultaneously peaceful and strained. As the space worked to facilitate this tension, it felt meditative. The interaction seemed to move inwards, creating a personal space within this seemingly collective utterance. </p>

	<p>We could each embody our silent revolution while together nodding to ‘the service of resistance and self-preservation, so we can ‘come together, find each other, and call out’’ that which holds us outside of our bodies. </p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>I find this notion of looking towards a space for “self preservation” to be an interesting one. The Biennale itself “explores the political potential of the act of self-preservation, refusing to be seduced by unyielding knowledge systems and historical narratives that contribute to the creation of toxic subjectivities”. </p>

	<p>In the frame of Gabi Ngcobo’s interview where she claimed that “we are all postcolonial”, self preservation seems to be the work of “postcolonial” artists. It nods to asking questions about who creates knowledge and systems of power. </p>

	<p>Thus, self preservation not only through questioning our identities, but also questioning the system of power in which we create them. She says it is important to take positions that are outside of the grand narratives and add them to what we consider knowledge and challenge constructions of history. She points to the quest for decolonisation - acknowledging and creating new configurations of knowledge and power. </p>
	
	<hr>

	<p>Thinking that we are all postcolonial feels a little turbulent to me because it frames our position today as not just a product of the passage of time. Rather, it scatters us across the globe. It points to the way space has changed and people have moved as the order of the world has changed. </p>

	<p>I think that by deeming ourselves as postcolonial, our bodies become a site of this turbulence. Then the work of self preservation, by way of rethinking systems of knowledge and power, becomes key to our postcolonial form. </p>

	<p>Like Sitting on a Man’s Head, it is stretching so to not forget how our bodies can move. It creates the space for a silent revolution. This Biennale calls on the creative manifestations that come of this revolution. WE DON’T NEED ANOTHER HERO is artists speaking to, and complicating our collective identities. What are your identities? Where are they? </p>
	
	<hr>
	
	<p>The call for creating new systems of knowledge and power is reflected in the curation of the Biennale. Oftentimes, the space between not only the Biennale sites, but also the artworks on display would feel vast. So much so between the artworks that some of the galleries, Academie de Kunste, in particular, felt like the place was void of something because of it. But I found that the unsaturated spaces were more so powerful. Especially in comparison to the claustrophobia I experience at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p> 

	<p>The emptiness allowed the artworks to take up whole spaces and allowed us more space to move into and around them. The nuance it seems to provide is that it seemed sparse. Not in a way that it lacked something, but rather as if it is optimistic that there is place for things to grow and more stories to be told. </p>

	<hr>

	<p>Despite the obvious that this Biennale emphasized putting forth a new generation of diverse international artists, no preference seems to be given to the medium of their art. Artists are not featured once, but multiple times, and showcase works in different mediums. I find this aspect tries to create a more structured narrative, giving more volume to an individual. But it still sends a specific message about their collective interests - “we” don’t need another hero.</p> 

    <p>The multimedia works of Firelei Baez that we saw at Akademie der Kunste brings lost and inaccessible histories forward. Her sculpture that contemplates the various iterations of the words “San-Soucie” speaks to having a multi-dimensional and sometimes, hybrid, understandings. This is reflected in her piece pictured below as well, where collages and paintings made over maps and blueprints she collected from books enforce a strong and complex notion of multiplicity and hybridity. </p>

	<p>Having homes in New York, New Delhi, Dubai and Lagos, it has always been most interesting to me to observe the nature of the cultural institutions that are available to the public in different parts of the world. I have been able to realise how art recognition and appreciation can be starkly different globally. </p>

    <p>Thiago said that part of curating the Biennale was taking interest in how people are thinking about art, but also how they are not thinking about it. And that they aim to open up the discussion to people outside of the artworld. I’m not sure how the Biennale will find success in that because these conversations that could only happen in Berlin would still largely be happening in Berlin.</p>

	<p>But still, in seeking to ponder the greater ways that art can intersect with politics, economics, globalisation and even nothingness, the Biennale prioritizes the voices of artists that are more remote - not from the Western world. I find that it spoke to the nature of the contemporary art scene I experienced budding in Lagos and Dubai. Where art often isn’t thought of, artists are collecting themselves in urban spaces and reflecting on how they have been shaped by history and dominant historical narratives. </p>

	<p>The result of this is a new system of knowledge and a fabulous shift in power! It demands that art made outside of the Western world be looked at in terms of the individual, societal responsiveness and aesthetic value, rather than as ethnographic objects. </p>

	<p>FURTHER NOTES:</p>
	
	<hr>

	
    <p>Going to Berlin, I was really excited to experience a part of the world with a history that was never primary to me (European). I wanted to visit the wall, but more so to view the art it carried, rather than the history. Berlinische Galerie, however, showed me something I failed to consider: that there would be art both on and of the wall. </p>

	<p>I think the pieces they included in their collection of art made in Berlin serve to demonstrate how artists could reimagine not only the surface of the wall, but also the wall itself. The wall in Rainer Fetting’s painting seems to glow in a manner that is strangely non threatening, which is juxtaposed in the darkness of Wolf Vostell’s wall canvas. </p>
    
    <p>Mural’s at the East Side Gallery similarly take a non-threatening approach to the wall. Though the history is present, they speak to promoting empathy, and solidarity. The mural somehow seems to extend itself into every wall in Berlin. I wondered how long it would take if someone tried to erase all the graffiti that makes the city. Not really being able to view all the surfaces of Berlin, I could assume that it’s just graffiti for graffitis sake. But I have begun to speculate that it might be a widespread Berliner belief that walls are actually built to be marked in some way. </p>

    <p>Visiting the Feurle Collection and the Boros Collection made me call to question the rubric that constructs what is and isn’t considered art.</p> 

    <p>Feurle, in particular, made me skeptical about the art market, about how far away we are between this sort of gallery, and the nature of the cosmopolitan openness that Berlin and the Berlin Biennale provided. It wasn’t even so much the stink of colonial legacy, and exoticization of the East that got to me. It was the pretentious manner in which we were told to keep our voices down so to not ruin the ambience of the collection. Also, that they claimed that placing the new and the old together was a juxtaposition that had never been done before. </p>

    <p>Feurle was a full sensory experience though. It brought to my attention facets of curatorial work that had never occured to me before: lighting that made it hard to actually see the art, scents, and temperature. It provided an explorative experience - almost as if we were the one’s venturing out into a new and unfamiliar place to find cool things to sail back to France with. </p>

    <p>Boros was interesting. Even though their collection was still very much societal responses in the same nature as the art shown at the Biennale, something about the space felt so loaded with commercial ambition. It felt rigid, not like it was art that stemmed out of the unconscious. </p>

	<p>If that is a heavy claim to make, I will add that perhaps the climate change was entirely because of the thick Berlin concrete walls.</p> 
	
	<hr>

	
	<p>The curation at the Hoffman Collection seemed to integrate the artworks into the gallery space. It was clear that nothing was put anywhere by coincidence. Space history, form, and aesthetic all laced into each other so that the experience was not one of the art, or the space, but that of a third dimension that was created. </p>

	<p>I think the significant attention to detail that the Hoffman Collection demonstrates speaks to the power of the curator. It addresses the extent to which curators can create and even divide spaces. But more so, it is telling of the nature of the appreciation this Germany based curator asks for of the art.  </p>

	<hr>
    
	<p>I wonder what this Biennale could be if it happened in an urban center outside of the Western world. I appreciate the curatorial efforts that focus on artists from parts of the world that are underrepresented. But I just don’t know if the sentiment of the Biennale will go the full length that it needs to go.</p>

	<p>The record of it will surely mark it as part of the revolution that it serves. However, it speaks to Berlin, and to the people who visit the exhibition in Berlin. Not to the people where these artists come from. In many cases, places where are is oftentimes not thought about. </p>

	<p>Having been able to experience it, I wish that it could extend itself to more. It highlights that there is still much that is unsaid, and more stories to be told. There is need for self preservation. As a young person, a hopeful artist, and literal byproduct of colonialism, the notion resonates with me. We certainly are postcolonial. But where do we go from here?</p>
